The \nu_r term going to zero seems incorrect in the initial simplification of the Friedman equations.

## To Do

Check the Torsion equations of motion and find a form for phi.

Substitute h = 0, hupup and hupup = 0 and the form for phi back into the notebook and get the substituted TEOMS and Friedman EOMs.

Simplify these equations of motion.

Next, finish getting the Einstein - Cartan Equation from the vielbein variation.

After that, set phi = 0 and n = 0 to remove torsion and see it it simplifies to the regular schwarzchild metric.
