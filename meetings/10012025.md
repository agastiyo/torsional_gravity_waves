## Completed Work

EOM notebook is fuctionally finished, just some minor bug fixes needed.

From the notebook so far, we have determined that in the torsion ansatz, h = 0 and f^{ij} = 0.

(h is 0, off diagonal elements of f are zero, diag elements of f are also zero)

## To Do

Fix any last bugs in the notebook, send the final equations to Indranil once finished.

Write the equations out in a clearer form (e.g. set the h and fs to be zero where they need to be and simplify)

Equations look quite promising at the moment, might have a paper earlier than expected.
