# 21 July 2025 Meeting

## Background Reading

**Requisites for Project Step 1-3:**

- Read Adshead, focusing on GR sections
- MUST understand secs 2 and 3
- Look at sec 4.1
  
For our project, the gravitational actions we will be focusing on are Adshead eqs 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5.

Our ansatz is Adshead eqs 3.3 and 3.4. We will also assume that the $V(\theta) = 0$ in eq 2.3.

**Requisites for Project Step 4:**

Go through the documentation for [xAct](https://www.xact.es), a tensor algebra package for Mathematica.

Indranil will provide some Mathematica notebooks for reference.

## Project Steps

General structure for a paper on Modified Gravity: Action, Assumption, Equations, Perturbations.

1. Start with the [Schwarzchild Metric](https://newion.uwinnipeg.ca/~dvincent/4500.6-001/Cosmology/Schwarzschild_Metric.htm)
2. Calculate the Vielbein. Use Gasperini, Bavera, Golovnev for reference on how to do so.
3. Define the ansatz.
4. Using Mathematica, calculate the Equations of Motion.

After this part, project can go in multiple directions.

## Future

Ideally the given steps should take about a month. ~6-7 hours/day?

International Modified Gravity Essay competition in March, want a finished paper to publish by a month before that to allow time to write up the essay.
