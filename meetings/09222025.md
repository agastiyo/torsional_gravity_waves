## Completed Work

Did bug fixing for the EOM notebook. It was just an error in the order of coordinates. Download the fixed notebook.

## To Do

Just some final checks: Calculate the [1,1,1] term of the spin connection by hand to see why sometimes the coords are written as numbers instead of r,theta,phi,tau.

The omega being calculated in the notebook is omega_bar (the torsionless spin connection) and the spinnew is adding omega_tilda (the torsion spin connection) to the already calculated omega_bar. Look at eq. 3.7 from Indranil's paper for the equation for this.

From Indranil's paper use eqs. A.3 and A.4 to modify the spinnew calculation. You would want to add h^ij. f^ij is still zero, and h and phi are already included.
